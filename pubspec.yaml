  # Generation of bindings may fail if the libclang.so library is not found in
  # default locations. Here we can list few more locations to search in. Note
  # that the `lib/` directory is added, so e.g. if the lib is in
  # `/usr/lib/libclang.so` one needs to add `/usr` here as the path to search
  # in.
